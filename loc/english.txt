    "parable_coward_c": "Waiting was the best, and safest option. Maybe then something will come up on the screen telling him what to do.",
    "parable_coward_d": "He waited, minutes, hours, days, even weeks. He waited so long he couldn't remember anything but the inside of his own office.",
    "parable_coward_e": "But he held out, waiting till new orders came in. Poor old Rickie.",
    "parable_cheat_a": "Richard, this is me being serious. In fact, this is my serious basement, for serious people,",
    "parable_cheat_b": "Inside my serious house. The reason why I brought you here is because you tried to activate Free Flight",
    "parable_cheat_c": "and ran the risk of breaking the entire map. Honestly, I'm quite appalled you TRIED to break and disrespect my work.",
    "parable_cheat_d": "I am subjecting you to the most severe punishment I can think of. Sitting here In silence for 30 seconds. Starting now.",
    "parable_cheat2_a": "Wha, really? You tried to cheat again? Are you kidding? Okay, for that you are getting my most",
    "parable_cheat2_b": "MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT. Thats right Richard, 60 seconds in silence.",
    "parable_cheat_mp_a": "Richard...I see you brought friends. While normally I would be very proud",

    "parable_spoilers_b": "This is unintentional, and we must be vigilant in reporting it to the mod's authors. I'll let you into the gaming room for a moment, come here.",
    "parable_mws1": "So, here we are on the Modworkshop.net website. Let's go find the para... wait, what's that on the homepage?",
    "parable_mws2": "Oh, gee! A body pillow mod! I'm just going to download this for a moment... and, cool. It's installed.",
    "parable_mws3": "Wonderful! Oh, this reminds me of another mod I saw on some 'Payday content creator' video. Now this looks like fun. Installed.",
    "parable_mws4": "Regardless, here it is. The Pain Parable mod page. Quite the mod, wouldn't you agree? Let's post a comment with a bug report for the nice developers to fix it. Which wording would you prefer?",
    "parable_mws_a": "*in nerd voice* Hey there. I love this map, but there's this small bug where you get to the facility early and it spoils the map! Please fix it, thank you.",
    "parable_mws_b": "*in troglodyte voice* I GOT TO THE SECRET FACILITY EARLY. BIG SPOILERS. MAP BROKEN. PLEASE FIX IT!!",
    "parable_mws5_a": "Great choice! Attaching a screenshot... and posted. Oh... It seems we've forgotten to put a spoiler filter on the screenshot...",
    "parable_mws5_b": "Hss... May have spoiled it for everyone else reading the comments now. Oops."
    "parable_mws6_a": "And what's this up here? In known issues: 'Elevator leads to the secret facility earlier than intended.' Oh, man.",
    "parable_mws6_b": "Uh... I didn't read. I can't read! I didn't read the modpage! I can't read the modpage! I CAN'T READ THE",
    "parable_lair_boss": "Richard walked straight ahead through the large door that read: 'Stock Control Facility'",
    "parable_facility1": "The lights rose on an enormous room. 'What horrible secret did this place hold?' Richard thought to himself.",
    "parable_facility2_a": "Now, the facility jumped to life, its true nature revealed. Each screen bore a stock, all monitored, all manipulated,",
    "parable_facility2_b": "in this place where the free market meant nothing. The company that he had entrusted has been working illegitimately all along.",
    "parable_facility3": "As he approached the horrible machines, Richard was shocked to learn how StarVR was being manufactured infinitely, artificially changing the value.",
    "parable_facility4_a": "Now confronted with the Valhalla Vault, he stood in awe of the realization:",
    "parable_facility4_b": "There was absolutely nothing there. The fake promises allowed millions to be embezzled.",
    "parable_facility5": "Richard valiantly decided to put a stop to the madness, once and for all. Upon reaching the controls, he turned the power off.",
    "parable_on": "Richard decided to keep the machine powered on, stay with the company, and witness the downfall. This decision changed him forever...",
    "parable_raid1": "As the machine came to life, so did the entrances to the facility. Police forces were raiding the company building, and they quickly approached the secret lair.",
    "parable_raid2_a": "Richard panicked, began searching everywhere to turn off the machine. Button, after button, after button, he pressed. But to no avail.",
    "parable_raid2_b": "'Oh, maybe this green button will do. Or this yellow one.', Richard said. But no matter what color buttons, and what order he pressed them,",
    "parable_raid2_c": "the police were coming, and there was nothing to stop them. You know, it's quite funny, watching you try to and beat this game, Richard.",
    "parable_raid2_d": "Maybe there's an ending for finding the right button. You know, my main man looked into the files and there's actually secret code where it shows you what the right button is, and where it is located.",
    "parable_raid2_e": "Have you tried restarting the game? That could work. I really hope you didn't. I was lying.",
    "parable_raid2_f": "You know, now that I think about it, I don't think the button's in this room. It might be somewhere else. It might be in Ready Player None.",
    "parable_raid2_g": "Stalk Fraud. Holiday Special. BOWORKS. Somewhere, but not here.",
    "parable_raid2_h": "Let me tell you the truth, Richard. There is none. There is no button. I did enjoy watching you running around aimlessly.",
    "parable_raid3": "With a full police assault storming the facility, Richard was arrested in front of the machine, and got blamed for the faults of the company.",
    "parable_jail_a": "Richard served 2 months in jail, with half a year of community service. After serving his sentence,",
    "parable_jail_b": "Richard went off the grid, later reemerging as the notorious Pain.",
    "parable_off_a": "And so, Richard turned off the machine and finally freed himself from the grasp of the company.",
    "parable_off_b": "He then realized he had to make a true choice.",
    "parable_off_choice": "Now having quit the foreboding company of old, Richard could either pursue a professional game development career or get into modding videogames as a hobby.",
    "parable_career1": "Richard chose to continue his professional career by creating his own game development studio. After getting acquainted with his new office, he started by hiring some employees.",
    "parable_career2": "Well, look at your new, passionate developers go! Oh...I know of a way to get ahead in this competitive market. Let's order some cutting-edge technology for us to use.",
    "parable_career3": "Hmm, while these brand-new toys are great, we're out of pocket. Let's promise the public a product so we can get some funding - Nevermind that it isn't done, or, well... exists at all just yet.",
    "parable_career4": "Alright, now we simply wait for the game to be finished by our lovely employees. See you in a financial quarter or two, Richard.",
    "parable_career5": "Oh, hello! How long has it been, Richard? A YEAR?! And we have nothing to show for it! Jesus fuck! We have no capital, and scraps to pay the workers with!",
    "parable_career6": "No, no, no, all the employees are leaving. We have to downsize and salvage the game somehow. Let's move quickly to a new, more cost-effective office.",
    "parable_career7": "God, it seems we've repeated some mistakes. It always comes full circle... Anyways, I've been talking to a major Chinese publisher to perhaps invest in our venture...",
    "parable_modding": "Richard chose modding as the passion of his life. Like any modder, he started by creating a brand new project.",
    "parable_newproject1": "Richard, think about the immense variety of things you could create! Anything you can think of - New game modes, content, everything! I know... Let's make us an overhaul mod.",
    "parable_cancelproject1": "Wait, no, no, that's too ambitious for a first mod of a game. Close the project. Let's think of a new idea.",
    "parable_newproject2": "How about a brand new custom map that is entirely comprised of custom-made assets?",
    "parable_cancelproject2": "Nevermind. I don't know how to use 3D modeling software. Cancel it.",
    "parable_newproject3": "Right, right, right... We're going to make a simple replacement mod. I don't care which.",
    "parable_cancelproject3": "And that immediately crashed the computer. Just delete it. Delete everything, delete it all.",
    "parable_modding_end": "It seems that you're unable to release any mod of value. You've become a real modder!",
    "parable_escape1": "Richard, this path leads to certain death. Turn back, right now.",
    "parable_escape2": "You're so close to unlocking the secrets of the company! Come back, right now!",
    "parable_escape3": "You were warned. You do not destroy my story without consequence. In fact, I'm quite happy to see you die.",
    "parable_escape4": "Goodbye, dick.",
    "parable_museum1": "What was the Narrator hoping to accomplish by locking the player into inescapable death?",
    "parable_museum2": "Is it intentionally bad level design? I believe the answer lies within the ancestry of the map.",
    "parable_museum3": "'The concept was to combine all of the worst objectives into one heist.'... Huh.",
    "parable_museum4": "8 days to completion... That is particularly worrying.",
    "parable_museum5": "50 minutes of hacking computers? Urgh, that does it, these maps are terribly designed!",
    "parable_museum6": "BOFA what? God, no, no, this fucking sucks! I hate it!",
    "parable_museum7": "I mean, look at this! Does this look like fucking quality? No! I'm shutting it down.",
    "parable_museum8_a": "That lever - it brings you back to the game. Don't bother. Quit -",
    "parable_museum8_b": "- for your own good. For the love of all god.",
    "parable_museum9": "Why did y- Quit the map! Now! It's not worth it! You'll just go back to the start of this fucking piece of shit-",
    "parable_woodenplank": "Hey! Come back inside right now!",
    "parable_across_woodenplank_a": "Richard. You Really did a good one there. You think you're so smart going across the plank, defying my orders all smugly instead of going back to where the story was.",
    "parable_across_woodenplank_b": "Oh Richard. Richard, Richard, Richard. Can't you see? Can't you see, there are no choices here but my own Richard. This is my story.",
    "parable_crazy1_a": "You see? We're back in the office. I choose where the story goes, not you.",
    "parable_crazy1_b": "Did you ever think of what happened to your coworkers? Why when you look out windows, you see nothing?",
    "parable_crazy1_c": "That's because I made it that way. I've forced you to live the same day, over and over",
    "parable_crazy1_d": "and over for eternity. The worst day of your life, Richard. The day you got fired,",
    "parable_crazy1_e": "and your life turned from a normal citizen, to the husk of a man you now are.",
    "parable_crazy1_f": "You are NOTHING now. You sit there, and vape your life away. Look at how successful you used to be. Working in a game company,",
    "parable_crazy1_g": "on the up and up, You could have left when you knew the company was going under. You could have had it all.",
    "parable_crazy1_h": "But you threw it all away because of loyalty. LOYALTY,",
    "parable_crazy1_i": "for that scumbag CEO. The CEO that ruined everything, and blamed it on you Richard.",
    "parable_crazy1_j": "And now you've devoted yourself to enacting Revenge. And look how close you got...",
    "parable_crazy1_k": "you were this close to doing it. Ending his VR tirade and bringing him down for good.",
    "parable_crazy1_l": "But you let your guard down. You got captured. All because you wanted that fucking stupid bike.",
    "parable_crazy1_m": "No wonder you got caught Richard. Now, I'm letting you go back, back to another cycle.",
    "parable_crazy1_n": "I hope you enjoy it, because I sure am, watching you suffer like you should. Goodbye Richard.",
    "parable_across_woodenplank_backwards": "Wait Hold on. What did you just do? Thats not even supposed to be a choice you make, Richard.",
    "parable_choices_start_a": "Do you know your choices have consequences, Richard? *pause* Wait that's probably exactly it, isn't it? You don't understand how important these choices are.",
    "parable_choices_start_b": "Okay Richard, let me give you a brief, but comprehensive guide on the 'importante' of choice.",
    "parable_choices_guide": "Okay Richard, your choices have consequences. If you make the wrong choices you could end up in a situation like this. Life goes by you fast, so you need to make sure you make the right choices when you can. Like do you want to be an Olympian? Maybe you want to be on a famous sportsball team? Or maybe you want to meet that special someone at the dance? These are all terrible choices Richard and your life will come crashing down if you do anything like that. How about we start small, what would you like for dinner Richard? *pause* Great choice. Now as you can see something as small as what you're going to eat has a consequence. Now you're on the front line to Normandy. Lets try again, what do you want for dinner? *pause* Better choice, except you're not stuck with this little monster, and look, you made it cry. Good Job Richard. How about we stick to Tea this time and stay in line with the correct choices unless you want to end up like this man. Now this has been the Pain Parable guide to choice. Now back to the Office.",
    "parable_choices_choices1": "Okay Richard, now that you know the importances of choice, I say we go ahead and try the left, right door choice again.",
    "parable_choices_choices2_a": "Wha, what the fuck Richard? You completely fucked up my map! Ugh....fucking... Okay. Okay, okay.",
    "parable_choices_choices2_b": "It's time to stay calm, stay calm. Oh my god... I'm just going to soft restart the map, see if that works.",
    "parable_choices_choices3_a": "Okay Richard, you...you..fucking dumbass. You gotta cook a forklift to get past this wall. My fucking bike!",
    "parable_choices_choices3_b": "My fuc...*random conglomeration of Pain voice lines*",
    "parable_choices_choices4_a": "God... Come on, man. You have to make a choice. How are you going to get out of this situation? Come on,",
    "parable_choices_choices4_b": "do something, you fucking dumbass. If we got ourselves in this situation, we can get out of it.",
    "parable_choices_choices4_c": "Fucking Bo, how did he get us? Fuck. Who do we contact? Cocke?",
    "parable_choices_choices4_d": "Cocke would've known what to do. How do I even contact him now? Come on, come on, Richard, think.",
    "parable_choices_choices4_e": "Think! Aww come on Richard, think! You gotta make a decision to get out of this hell hole."
    "parable_redblue_door1_a": "Wha, Really? Are you that convinced something bad is going to happen to you?",
    "parable_redblue_door1_b": "I don't know how to convince you of this. But I really do want to help you, to show you how beautiful this story is. Look, let me prove it.",
    "parable_redblue_door1_c": "Let me prove to you that I'm on your side. Now listen to me, this is very important.",
    "parable_redblue_door1_d": "If you listen you'll get everything you've always wanted. Richard walked, through the red door.",
    "parable_redblue_blue1": "Okay, I don't think you heard me correctly then. Richard walked through the RED door.",
    "parable_redblue_blue2": "Okay, clearly you are an idiot. Let's try this ONE more time. Richard WALKED through the RED door.",
    "parable_redblue_blue3_a": "Okay FINE. If your stubbornness wants to see whats on the other side of the blue door then fine, go ahead.",
    "parable_redblue_blue3_b": "See? Nothing, I haven't even built this area of the map yet. Are you happy? Do you feel accomplished?",
    "parable_redblue_blue3_c": "Clearly you don't enjoy this map and just are here to spite me. Fine then, if you really hate this map let me try and make something that I think you'll like.",
    "parable_redblue_red1": "Oh thank fuck you are willing to listen to me. Do you see? Do you see I have been on your side all this time. Now, let me show you I was not lying.",
    "parable_stuck_a": "To show that Richard was in control, like the idiot he is, he got himself stuck. I cannot believe this.",
    "parable_stuck_b": "Welp, you have fun there, Im gonna be back later.",
    "parable_babygame_start_a": "In this map, or should I say heist, you press this button to restart the drill. It's a very meaningful game all about the art  of robbery,",
    "parable_babygame_start_b": "and confronting the endless demands and tedium of the current world. I think Modworkshop will really take the notice.",
    "parable_babygame_start_c": "But of course, the vault only opens after you've been drilling for about....hmmm...2 hours.",
    "parable_babygame_start_d": "So why don't you give it 2 hours of play to make sure it's effective. Be sure to keep notes on your experience.",
    "parable_babygame_1": "Keep it up Richie boy, you're only 15 minutes in. You're doing great.",
    "parable_babygame_2_a": "Oh good, you're still here. I see you're really here for the long haul. Although I doubt you're doing this without some sort of auto click program.",
    "parable_babygame_2_b": "How about this, jump for me so I know you're really there. Hah, made you jump, hopefully.",
    "parable_babygame_3_a": "Hey, just popping in again. 45 minutes?",
    "parable_babygame_3_b": "Impressive. Now Richard, I do hope you're here for the intense four, I mean, single player action shooter that",
    "parable_babygame_3_c": "this game is and not just for the commentary. This heist is so meaningful.",
    "parable_babygame_3_d": "Yeah, keep pressing that button Richard!",
    "parable_babygame_3_e": "Wait hold on...this isn't a shooter. Give me 15 minutes and I will be right bac k.",
    "parable_babygame_4_a": "Okay Richard, I have been thinking since we last spoke. This isn't a shooter. But it has to be.",
    "parable_babygame_4_b": "Now to get the true heisting experience, let's add some cops. YES OH I DO LOVE COPS TRYING TO INTERRUPT THE DRILL.",
    "parable_babygame_4_c": "HIT THOSE BUTTONS TO STOP THEM RICHARD, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T GET TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF THE VAULT AND OF THIS HEIST. Now this is pure art!",
    "parable_babygame_4_d": "Oh wait should I call it, hmmm. Well, Overmill? No no no....Overdrill? Nah, too basic.",
    "parable_babygame_4_e": "Ah I got it, Overkill! Now kill those cops Richard, you cant let them get to the drill.",
    "parable_babygame_4_f": "Only one more hour to go!",
    "parable_babygame_5_a": "Hows the cop killing going Richard. Is the sense of pride and accomplishment filling you up yet? Oh cause it is for me,",
    "parable_babygame_5_b": "I wish there were more cops though. Do you think? Like, what if there was an assault of 108 cops all coming at once.",
    "parable_babygame_5_c": "Oh yes, 10 minutes of endless assaults, just for a 10 second break before doing it all over again.",
    "parable_babygame_5_d": "Oh my, I should write this down Richard, we could make a lot of money with this idea.",
    "parable_babygame_6_a": "Oh how the time flies when you're killing cops and having fun. Can you believe it's been an hour and a half already? Goodness.",
    "parable_babygame_6_b": "Oh no, you don't have to answer that. I understand you're quite busy enjoying my heist. But Keep at it Richard, you're almost there.",
    "parable_babygame_7_a": "Nearly there Richard. Soon enough all of this will be worth it. Overkill is just behind that door. Aren't you excited?",
    "parable_babygame_7_b": "Just a few more seconds.....",
    "parable_babygame_fail_a": "Really? You let it jam? God forbid you have to do ANYTHING for 2 hours and keep paying attention.",
    "parable_babygame_fail_b": "You know, life isn't filled with Subway Surfer or mobile games to keep you stimulated, Richard.",
    "parable_babygame_fail_c": "Fine, you seem to hate my heist anyway. How about we try someone else's. Nothing like stealing content for a heisting game, what do you say Richard?",
    "parable_heist1_1_a": "Alright, here you go Richard. What do you think of this? Is this more your style? Its a hardware store! And not just any hardware store,",
    "parable_heist1_1_b": "THE Hardware Store. I found it on Modworkshop, made by Payday 2 Maps Group. Wow, this is quite ambitious for a map,",
    "parable_heist1_1_c": "and his second map at that. Come on Richard, let's take a look around.",
    "parable_heist1_2_a": "Uhh...Richard. I don't know about you, but do you see anything of value to steal here? No?",
    "parable_heist1_2_b": "Yeah, me neither. For a heist, this doesn't seem like an appropriate place to steal from. Like, where's the money, the guns, the drugs!",
    "parable_heist1_2_c": "Come on Payday 2 Maps, you can do better than this. What do you want us to steal, some hammers and plywood?",
    "parable_heist1_2_d": "Maybe there's a secret lair or something? Actually, now that I say it, let's try another heist shall we?",
    "parable_heist2_1_a": "Ah, here we are! The Secret lair. I sure do love this map from Sora. Thankfully, I still have it downloaded before it got taken down.",
    "parable_heist2_1_b": "Oh Richard, isn't this great? I'm sure they have some high tech in here that I'm sure has to be worth at least 2 dollars on the blackmarket.",
    "parable_heist2_1_c": "Come on Rick, let's go find it.",
    "parable_heist2_2_a": "I can't find anything, Richard. Except for those 2 vault doors, and we can't even get in there. We already used up one of my drills on the heist,",
    "parable_heist2_2_b": "and god knows we don't have an infinite amount of drills. Ugh... This is really disappointing, Richard, I thought there would have been a secret here, a good secret.",
    "parable_heist2_2_c": "With puzzles, and riddles or something. You know, something a secret lair would have. I think the developer should make remake this.",
    "parable_heist2_2_d": "With a secret that spans over multiple heists! Yes Richard, now that would have been entertaining!",
    "parable_heist2_2_e": "What was that Richard? Oh, do you have an idea? Oh wonderful Richard, let's see it!"
    "parable_heist3_1_a": "Oh wow, Richard! Y..you made this? This is... Well, I see you put lots of effort into this",
    "parable_heist3_1_b": "and I'm very proud. You did an amazing job with the... The art direction.",
    "parable_heist3_1_c": "I personally would have stuck with my art direction instead of stealing other peoples work but, that's just me. How about this Richard, April fools is coming up.",
    "parable_heist3_1_d": "Why don't I take this concept and turn it into reality? There will be some funny dialogue, multiple characters, an intense and thrilling story line...",
    "parable_heist3_1_e": "Heisting, objectives... And most importantly Richard, a secret. Yes... this is what I will do.",
    "parable_heist3_1_f": "The secret will be like the one from Ready Player One, my favourite book. In it, there's 3 keys, and they need the keys to take over VR, but in this heist I will-",
    "parable_zen_a": "Now, Richard, are you prepared for what you REALLY wanted? Here it is: Secrets and Infinite bags.",
    "parable_zen_b": "Isn't this enjoyable? Just get to sit here and get all this money! It's like a plus heist, but better!",
    "parable_zen_c": "Ah, just watching those bags being secured infinitely... its like ASMR for the eyes.",
    "parable_zen_d": "You know? I think.....I think I'm truly happy.",
    "parable_leave1": "What the... Wher-where are you going?",
    "parable_leave2": "Uhh, if you go up those stairs you could hurt yourself! Come back! If you die it'll reset!",
    "parable_leave3": "Richard, come-Richard, come back! Please. PLEASE. Don't take this! I want to be happy!",
    "parable_leave4": "Please Rick, think about what you're doing!",
    "parable_leave5": "NO! No, no, no, no, no, no!",
    "parable_land1": "Oh, thank fuck you lived! You had me worried there. Please, let's just-let's just go back to the other room.",
    "parable_stairs2_1_a": "No, no, what the hell are you doing? Please don't do this. Think-think about what you're doing. Please.",
    "parable_stairs2_1_b": "If you die we both go back! Please! Please don't do this, I don't want to go back!",
    "parable_goback1": "Oh, thank fuck. You're finally seeing the enjoyment of the plus heists, huh?. Ahhhh......",
    "parable_goback2": "Nope...I guess not.",
    "parable_stairs3_1_a": "My god.... Is this really how much you dislike plus heists... That you're willing to keep throwing yourself off the stairs to get out of here?",
    "parable_stairs3_1_b": "That you're willing to literally kill yourself to keep me from being happy? What the fuck is wrong with you?",
    "parable_stairs3_2_a": "Or maybe you're just getting a kick out of this...I don't know. I just wanted us to get along, for both of us to be happy.",
    "parable_stairs3_2_b": "But I guess you've finally made a choice now... Well, the choice is yours.",
    "parable_stairs_dead": "Is it over? It's going to restart, isn't it... I just want you to know tha-",
    "parable_adv_garage_start_a": "Richard, so afraid to confront his Boss, to show to his boss that he was willing to leave his post, decided the best course of action was to leave.",
    "parable_adv_garage_start_b": "He headed down to the Garage where his-wait hold on. Where's your car Richard? I don't remember which car you drive. Can you find it? Is it one of these?",
    "parable_adv_garage_2_a": "Richard, I don't think your car is here. Do you remember where you parked at all? I sure don't.",
    "parable_adv_garage_2_b": "Okay Richard, give me one second Im going to look through the story, and see if i can find out where you parked.",
    "parable_adv_garage_3_a": "Okay, what would you like to hear first, good news or the bad news? Bad news? Got it.",
    "parable_adv_garage_3_b": "So, bad news. I can't go beyond you sitting in your desk. And the good news, I found something that can help us. Go back upstairs, and I'll show you!",
    "parable_adv_garage_4_a": "Okay Richard, are you ready? I don't think you are.",
    "parable_adv_garage_4_b": "IT'S THE STA-I MEAN- THE PAIN ADVENTURE LINE. Totally unique, not copied.",
    "parable_adv_garage_4_c": "Okay Richard, go follow it, and it'll show us where the story needs to go.",
    "parable_adv_garage_5_a": "No no no! Bad adventure line. That isn't the ending we want! Richard, don't look, this is spoilers.",
    "parable_adv_garage_5_b": "Okay I'm going to restart, and let's see if we can try this one more time",
    "parable_advline_start_a": "Okay Richard, this time it's for real. This time, let's see where the Adventure really takes us. Because, I don't know about you, but -",
    "parable_advline_start_b": "I've been thoroughly confused the entire time we've been together. I really have no idea where this story is intending to go.",
    "parable_advline_start_c": "I also found this, maybe this will help us while we follow it.",
    "parable_advline_stop": "W-wh-Wait hold on, stop the music, stop the music. Ugh, where did the Adventure Line go this time? Richard, do you see it anywhere?",
    "parable_advline_see_line_a": "Oh, there it is. You know, I was starting to think this place looks very familiar. Is it just me? Now that I think about it,",
    "parable_advline_see_line_b": "the entire time we were walking felt like we were going around in a circle. Literally, Richard. I don't know what kind of drugs the line is on, but I think I want in.",
    "parable_advline_see_start_a": "Oh for fucks sake, line, you led is right back to the start! Line, we told you this is a spoiler! Richard isn't supposed to see this ending yet.",
    "parable_advline_see_start_b": "*mouse like talking as the line speaks to the narrator* Uh-huh, Oh. Okay. Yeah I see.",
    "parable_advline_see_start_c": "*talking continues* Yeah that is a good idea. *pause* Richard, the Adventure line just told me this is NOT a spoiler after all.",
    "parable_advline_see_start_d": "It's a NEW ending. Richard, are you ready to see the ending? Okay, I will unblock the ending",
    "parable_advline_see_start_e": "and then you jump right out of the window and see the beauty that is 'The Adventure Line Ending!'",
    "parable_advline_death_a": "This is the story of a woman named Mariella. Mariella woke up on a day like any other. Woke up, got dressed, and walked to her place at work.",
    "parable_advline_death_b": "But this particular day was not like any other. Today she got interrupted when a man was screaming 'Adventure Line Ending!'.",
    "parable_advline_death_c": "And although she would soon take out her phone to call the ambulance, for a brief moment she considered the strange man. He was obviously crazy, this was- This is what she knew.",
    "parable_advline_death_d": "Everyone knows what a crazy person looks like. And for a brief moment, she thought to herself, how lucky she was to be normal.",
    "parable_advline_death_e": "'I am sane, I am in control of my mind, I know what's real and what isn't'. It was comforting to think like this.",
    "parable_advline_death_f": "In a certain way, it made her feel better. But then she remembered she had a meeting to get to. One with important people that would reflect her career,",
    "parable_advline_death_g": "and by extension the rest of her life. So only for a brief moment she stood there looking at the body, before she turned away and ran."
